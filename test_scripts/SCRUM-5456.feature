The provided Jira issue is very high-level, lacking critical functional requirements (the "what" and "how"). Since no description is provided, the following Gherkin script infers standard best practices for displaying and managing content (stories/articles) on a website or platform.

This comprehensive script covers accessibility, content integrity, and basic interaction.

## Gherkin Test Script: Research and Innovation Stories

**Feature:** Research and Innovation Stories Presentation and Accessibility
**Jira Issue:** STORY-XXXX (Research and Innovation Stories)
**Goal:** Verify that R&I Stories are correctly displayed, accessible, and contain required metadata for users.

***

### Scenario 1: Successful Navigation and Landing Page Display
*Verifies that the main hub page for the stories is accessible and loads correctly.*

**@Smoke @Accessibility**
**Given** I am a standard web user
**When** I navigate to the Research and Innovation Stories hub page
**Then** The page should load successfully with a 200 HTTP status code
**And** I should see the main heading containing the text "Research and Innovation Stories"
**And** I should see a minimum of 3 published story cards displayed

### Scenario 2: Integrity of Story Card Components (List View)
*Verifies that each individual story card displayed on the hub page contains essential metadata and links.*

**@Regression @ContentIntegrity**
**Scenario Outline:** Each displayed story card must present required elements

| Element | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Title | The story's main headline must be visible. |
| Author/Source | The credit or author must be present (if applicable). |
| Publication Date | A valid date format must be visible. |
| Teaser/Summary | A short excerpt of the story text must be visible. |
| Read More Link | A clickable link or button to the full story must be present. |
| Image/Thumbnail | A relevant visual representation of the story must be displayed. |

**Given** I am viewing the Research and Innovation Stories hub page
**When** I inspect the details of the 'Story ID: 12345' card
**Then** The `<Element>` should be visible and not empty

### Scenario 3: Successful Access to Full Story Content
*Verifies that clicking on a story card correctly redirects the user to the dedicated, full article page.*

**@Smoke @Interaction**
**Given** I am viewing the Research and Innovation Stories hub page
**And** I have located a published story titled "Breakthrough in Fusion Power"
**When** I click the 'Read More' link associated with that story
**Then** I should be redirected to the dedicated article URL for "Breakthrough in Fusion Power"
**And** The dedicated page should load successfully with a 200 HTTP status code
**And** The page should display the full body content of the story
**And** The main heading (H1) on the page should match the title "Breakthrough in Fusion Power"

### Scenario 4: Story Categorization and Filtering Functionality
*Verifies that users can filter the stories based on common categories (e.g., by topic, date, or research area).*

**@Functional @Filtering**
**Given** I am viewing the Research and Innovation Stories hub page
**And** The system contains stories tagged with categories 'Physics', 'Biology', and 'Partnerships'
**When** I select the category filter "Physics"
**Then** Only story cards tagged with "Physics" should be displayed
**And** The count of displayed stories should be greater than zero

**When** I select the filter option to sort by "Newest First"
**Then** The first story displayed should have the most recent publication date
**And** The last story displayed should have the oldest publication date among the displayed set

### Scenario 5: Handling of Missing or Draft Content
*Verifies system behavior when a user attempts to access a story that is unpublished or invalid.*

**@EdgeCase @Security**
**Given** I have the direct URL for a story that has been saved as 'Draft' (unpublished)
**When** I attempt to access the Draft Story URL
**Then** I should receive a 404 (Not Found) HTTP status code
**And** I should be presented with a standardized 'Page Not Found' error message

**Given** I have the direct URL for a story that was recently 'Archived' (deleted)
**When** I attempt to access the Archived Story URL
**Then** I should receive a 410 (Gone) or 404 (Not Found) HTTP status code
**And** I should not be able to view the content of the deleted story
